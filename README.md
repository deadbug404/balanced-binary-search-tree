# Balanced Binary Search Tree

My own implementation of a Balanced Binary Search Tree in javascript. A binary search tree consists of nodes where each node has either a child in its left side that is less than the nodes value or a child in its right side that is greater than the nodes value. It can be considered as balanced if the roots subtrees has at most 1 difference in its height.
